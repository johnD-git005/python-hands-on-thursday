Task 4: Pocket Money Records
You're building a small tracker for your younger sibling's weekly pocket money.
The amounts (in naira) for the past 5 weeks are stored like this:
money = [1000, 1200, 800, 1500, 1100]

1. Calculate and display the total amount received so far.
2. A mistake was made in the third week's entry (800). It should have been 1000. Fix it.
3. Display the list in reverse order to check most recent payments first.

â†’ Perform the corrections and computations, and print all results.
